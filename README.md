# Intro

Pause and play your YouTube videos while cooking/crafting/doing your makeup by waving your hand over the Adafruit Proximity trinkey!! Super clean way to follow along with a tutorial without having to get your keyboard/trackpad dirty ðŸ˜Ž

# Code

Make sure to follow along the tutorial on Adafruit's website to set up your IDE and go through the sample code for detecting motion. 
https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-proximity-trinkey/arduino-ide-setup

The code file in this repo adds onto the sample code, by automatically clicking the letter "K" when motion is detected, which is the shortcut for pausing or playing a video.
